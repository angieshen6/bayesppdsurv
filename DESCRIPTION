Description: Bayesian power/type I error calculation and model fitting using 
  the power prior and the normalized power prior for piecewise constant hazard models.
  Detailed examples of applying the package are available at <arXiv:2112.14616>. 
  The Bayesian clinical trial design methodology is described in Chen et al. (2011) 
  <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01561.x>, and Psioda and Ibrahim (2019) 
  <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy009>. The normalized power prior is described in Duan et al. (2006) 
  <doi:10.1002/env.752> and Ibrahim et al. (2015) <doi:10.1002/sim.6728>.
