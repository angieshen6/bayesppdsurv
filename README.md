# BayesPPDSurv

BayesPPDSurv (Bayesian Power Prior Design for Survival Data) supports Bayesian clinical trial design after incorporating historical data with the power prior and the normalized power prior for time-to-event outcomes. We implement the proportional hazards model with piecewise constant hazard. The package can be installed on R using the command "install_github("angieshen6/bayesppdsurv")". The full package will be available on CRAN soon.
